<h2>Hello!</h2>
<p>I am a former engineer of low-voltage networks, who has learned to code during the last year. I strongly decided to make programming as my career. I am really involved into building high-quality, user/mobile friendly websites. My main specialization right now is building responsive cross-browser websites from PSD to HTML5 with CSS3 and JQuery and with or without Twitter Bootstrap.</p>

<p>I am responsible, accurate, communicative person. During our collaboration whatever you can request that i am not familiar with, i will read-up and figure it out. My goal is to produce a high-quality product.</p>

<p>Here are my <strong>experience and skills:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Core web: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript</li>
<li>Frameworks: jQuery, Bootstrap 4</li>
<li>Preprocessors: Sass, SCSS, LESS</li>
<li>Build system: Gulp</li>
<li>Package managers: npm, bower</li>

</ul>
